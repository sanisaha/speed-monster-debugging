                <p>If we close the browser and tab, history in local storage remain same but session storage become
                    empty. Local storage is permanent while session storage is temporary. Session storage store data for
                    a session. Data is deleted from session storage if we close the tab. In local storage, Data is
                    available for future session.</p>

                <p>Any variable that's not inside any function or block (a pair of curly braces), is inside the global
                    scope. The variables in global scope can be accessed from anywhere in the program. “Var” is a global
                    variable; it can be accessed from anywhere.
                    Block scope variables only accessed inside a block (a pair of curly braces), but outside not
                    available. For example, function with curly braces, if, else and for loop.

                <h3 class="fw-bold">3.How does event loop works?</h3>
                <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from
                    the Task Queue to the Call Stack.
                    (A stack is a data structure in which the last element added is always the first to be removed from
                    the stack, you could think of it as a stack of a plate in which only the first plate which was the
                    last added can be removed first. A Call Stack is simply nothing but a stack data structure where
                    tasks or code is being executed accordingly.)
                    Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks.
                    If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and
                    repeats the same process.
